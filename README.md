This is my first ETL&Analytics project after IBM's Python Project Course for Data Engineering.
First I extracted the data from a Wikipedia html page and then used a dictionary and pandas data frames to read the data. Due to the string problem,
I transformed the data frame column of the location. Then I loaded the dataframe into CSV format and DB format and wrote some queries on the data. 
Finally, I visualized my queries and wrote the results.
